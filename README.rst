Analysing Radio Astronomy Absorption Spectra
============================================

RadioAbsTools is a growing suite of tools for working with radio astronomy absorption spectra.
It is written with neutral hydrogen (HI) spectra in mind but should be adaptable to other lines.

Installation and Requirements
-----------------------------

RadioAbsTools works with Python 3.6 or later and requires Astropy v3 or later.

For local use it can be installed by downloading the source and then:

.. code:: bash

    cd radioabstools
    pip install -e .

RadioAbsTools required numpy, scipy and astropy.
